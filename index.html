                        I have been solving all the project ideas on roadmap.sh
                        and I am surprised how far I have come from where I
                        started.

                    Since starting my career in 2021, I have only followed one
                    resource, roadmap.sh, it truly helped me go from 0 to having
                    a job and changing the financial trajectory of my family

                        I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to all the
                        internees or junior developers. It's a great way to
                        skill up and grow in your career.

                    roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was fortunate to
                    discover it during my university days in 2018. Back then, it
                    was just a single repository with three images. It's amazing
                    to see how much impact it has had on milions of lives since
                    then.
